This repository consolidates my functional programming materials stacking up for many years. I used them for workshops, teachings, hackatons and more. Please note that, the materials of this repository are provided privately are not part officially part of my lectures and courses. If you are interested in consulting or professional courses tailored to your needs, please consoult me directly. Some of the material was provided  Also, i'm open for PR's for fixes or improvements.

Exercise sheets:
- [FP on familiar terrain](./exercise-sheets/1/exercise.pdf)
- [Reducing expressions and Performance optimizations](./exercise-sheets/2/exercise.pdf)
- [Composing Functions and Dealing with errors](./exercise-sheets/3/exercise.pdf)
- [Understanding datastructures](./exercise-sheets/4/exercise.pdf)
- [Folds and datastructures cont.](./exercise-sheets/5/exercise.pdf)

Projects, often used in student work:
- [The polygon sketching projects](https://github.com/haraldsteinlechner/polygon-sketching-project) aims in looking at UI applications from a FP perspective. The code is based on the [Feliz](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Feliz) and uses [Fable](http://fable.io/) for transpiling F# code to JS.
- [The (quite old) turtle project](./turtle-project/) shows parsing, language semantics and graphics including F# and Haskell implementations.
- [The METAR parsing case study](./parsing/) explores parsing using parser combinators solving a real problem. The code and the idea is based on [Chris's blogpost](https://entropicthoughts.com/parser-combinators-parsing-for-haskell-beginners)

Exercise sheets from my functional languages beginner course (those exercise sheets are authored and partly co-authored by [attila](https://github.com/aszabo314)).
- [first sheet](./beginners-course/1.pdf)
- [second sheet](./beginners-course/2.pdf) and extra [solution](beginners-course/lists-solutions.fsx)
